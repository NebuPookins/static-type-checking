These are a set of slides I've used to give a presentation about static type
checking, design by contract, Liskov substitution principle, and related topics.

I am releasing the slide contents under a Creative Commons

# Instructions for giving the presentation

* You use the arrow keys to navigate the slides. Generally, right-arrow moves
  forward in the presentation, and Left-arrow moves backwards.
* At the very bottom of the screen is a progress bar. Use that to judge if you
  need to speed up or slow down the presentation.
* At the bottom-right corner are navigation indicators. There are 4 directional
  triangles, that have 3 states each: Fully lit, partially lit, and dimmed.
** If the arrow is fully lit, it means pressing the corresponding arrow key will
   move on to another slide.
** If the arrow is partially lit, pressing the corresponding arrow key will stay
   on the same slide, but reveal/hide information on the slide.
** If the arrow is dimmed, pressing the corresponding arrow key will have no
   effect.
* If the "down" arrow is lit, it means there is a "deep dive" component to this
  slide.
** "Deep dives" are interesting, but optional, elaborations on the slide. You
   can skip that content, or go into the content as you please (e.g. depending
   on audience interest, on time remaining, etc.)
** You can do "partial deep dives"; e.g. perhaps there are 5 slides downards,
   but you only go down 3 of them, before pressing on the right arrow key, thus
   returning to the main content.
* If you need to "jump around" in the slides (e.g. the audience asks a question
  about something you showed 5 slides ago), press the Escape key to go into an
  overview navigation mode, then hit the Enter key to select the side.
